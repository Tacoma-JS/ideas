# Tacoma-JS Ideas


## Ideas for project

- Simple Weather App
  - Determine position with GPS. Pull from an external weather api (yahoo?). Render weather for current position.
- Twitter Stream Reader
  - Enter a hashtag. Connect to Twitter's API. Display a stream of tweets filtered by that hashtag.

## Possible Server Side Implementations
- AngularJS frontend using [XMLResume](http://www.xml-resume.com/d/) ![within Drupal](http://www.xml-resume.com/d/sites/all/themes/bootstrap/logo.png)
- using Github Pages to serve client side JS, and running any test cases from a seperate dev machine.


## Technologies to play with

- Angular
  - Popular framework for creating HTML frontends. Created by Google.
- Require / AMD
  - Module loading system. A way to keep your code broken up into modules on the frontend.
- React
  - A View/Component library created by Facebook. It uses a virtual DOM to simplify updating the view.
- Backbone
  - A flexible framework for MVC code.
- Promises
  - A better way to control async code. Rather then passing around callbacks to functions, promises allow you to pass around a promise for a value that will exist in the future. For example, jQuery's Ajax functions all reture promises.
